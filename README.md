#### The assignment:

Cloudexa Frontend Developer Interview Assignment Please create a single page application that consists of the following:
* A stacked list of notifications where each notification matches the mockup below: https://sketch.cloud/s/JKWa9/a/mJQ2v9
* A dismiss button per row that will remove a notification permanently from view.
* A filter that can be used to display only today’s notifications.

Please setup a free account at contentful.com to create a simple notification object and the API needed to fetch notifications from your single page app.
Feel free to use a UI library to achieve the desired outcome.
Finally, please be prepared to explain your workflow end-to-end, assuming that this is a business application and you are collaborating with at least one other developer.

## Run the application

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.

1.  Go to the workspace folder (my-app).  
    
2.  Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the \--open option.  
    

cd my-app

ng serve --open

The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

The \--open (or just \-o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/
