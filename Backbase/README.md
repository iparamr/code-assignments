#### The assignment:

Create an app that is capable of importing the attached MOCK_DATA.csv and visualize it on the screen.

Keep in mind the following:

*   1\. We prefer the app to be an Angular 6+ app.
*   2\. I should be able to select this file from my computer and see the results on screen.
*   3\. I should be able to filter the results based on minimal issue count.
*   4\. Act as if this code is meant to be production code for a Bank.

## Run the application

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.

1.  Go to the workspace folder (my-app).  
    
2.  Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the \--open option.  
    

cd my-app

ng serve --open

The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

The \--open (or just \-o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/
